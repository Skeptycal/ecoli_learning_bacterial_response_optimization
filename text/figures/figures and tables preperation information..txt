Figures and tables preparation sheet.

Figure 1: Overview of available gene expression data: 
The pptx file is at: 
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/sunburst
.R generate the figures:

Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/figure1.pdf
and 
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/figure_dummy.pdf

I combine them using GIMP and generated
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/figure1_combined2.png

I copyed the same figure as 
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig1_MainData.png


Figure 2: Machine learning pipeline.  
The figure is generated in power point with the file:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/ Figure2_Pipelinev6.pptx
The first slide is exported as; 
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/figrue_preperation/Figure2_Pipelinev7.png

and saved as
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig2_pipelineTuning.png



Figure 3: Performance of multi-class predictions. 
It is generated by: 
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/compare_mRNA_protein.R
The code save the figure:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_figures/compare_mRNA_protein_models.pdf
I manually save the figure as:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig3_Performance_of_multi-class_predictions.pdf





Figure 4. Prediction accuracy for specific growth conditions. 
It is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/compare_mRNA_protein.R (same R file that generates the figure 3)
The generated file is:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_figures/combined_mRNA_protein_square.pdf
(the file have a jpeg copy with the same name as well in the same folder)

I manually save the figure as:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig4_Prediction_accuracy_for_specific_growth_conditions.pdf




Figure 5. Models trained on both mRNA and protein data perform better than models trained on only one data type. 

It is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/increasePerformanceAfterCombine.R
The generated file is:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_figures/increasePerformanceAfterCombine_testAll.pdf
(the file have a jpeg copy with the same name as well in the same folder)

I manually save the figure as:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig5_Models_trained_on_both_mRNA_and+protein_data.pdf




Figure 6. Prediction accuracy systematically declines from exponential to stationary. 
It is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/exp_str.R
The generated file is:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_figures/changePerformanceExpSta_testAll.pdf
(the file have a jpeg copy with the same name as well in the same folder)

I manually save the figure as:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig6_Prediction_accuracy_systematically_declines_from_exponential_to_stationary.pdf


Figure 7. Model performance on univariate predictions.
It is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/distinctTests_mRNA_protein.R

The generated file is:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_figures/distinctTests_mRNA_Protein.pdf
(the file have a jpeg copy with the same name as well in the same folder)

I manually save the figure as:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/text/figures/fig7_Model_performance_on_univariate_predictions.pdf 



TABLES

Table 2 is generated by
It is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_code_MLRN/additionalFigures/increasePerformanceAfterCombine.R

The generated file is:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/b_results/p_values_increasePerformanceAfterCombine.csv"

Table 3 is generated by:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/outOfHouseData/paper2_Protein_part2.Rmd
When you knit it you will generate:
Github/ecoli_learning_bacterial_response_optimization/outOfHouseData/paper2_Protein_part2.html
The html file includes the tables needed
